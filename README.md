# Jiří Šebek

Hello! I'm Jiří, a public policy professional and researcher with a PhD in political science, now transitioning into data science and machine learning. I specialize in the intersection of computational methods and social systems — from natural language processing to ethical AI.

Currently focusing on:
- Applied machine learning (especially NLP and interpretability)
- Statistical modeling and data cleaning
- Python, R, and Jupyter workflows
- Open science and reproducible research

Recent coursework includes:
- Mathematics for Machine Learning (Imperial College London, Coursera)
- Data Science specializations (Johns Hopkins, IBM, Stanford)
- Projects in corpus analysis, political data mining, and PCA

I’m especially interested in collaborative projects at the boundary of data and society — such as:
- Analyzing political systems through networked data
- Experimental philosophy or ethics of algorithmic systems
- Responsible applications of AI in governance

My repositories will reflect ongoing study as I prepare for formal graduate-level training in data science.
